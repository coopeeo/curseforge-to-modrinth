## Usage

`curseforge-to-modrinth <modlist.html>`

See [below]() for more options

## About

This tool takes a modlist file from a CurseForge modpack and lists all mods in the pack that are available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/)

### Motivation

In mid-2022, popular 3rd-party Minecraft launcher, [MultiMC](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher) was requested to [remove support](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/commit/0a827ba70e6ef20187f8507a536d54a8441020dc) for downloading modpacks from CurseForge, by Overwolf. Considering that CurseForge announced more restrictions on their API before this, it was only a matter of time before Overwolf starts prohibiting 3rd-party launchers

### Future Plans

- Add downloading of mods
